	Memento0 = "Beauty... I struggle to find it in the world at this moment. The fighting has stopped and we are at peace, but father is gone. He will not come home and my heart is in pieces. Mother says the world is not fair sometimes. I saw this flower in the town paper. It is called the Mememto Florum, and when I saw, I remembered beauty does exist in this world. Mother has encouraged me to plant one in the garden. 'It shall be a new beginning,' she says. Perhaps so. The place is quite neglected.",
	Memento1 = "This flower has scarcely grown. Perhaps it is stuck in the same way I am. I am expected to bear a child as all good wives do for their husbands, but nobody has ever told me it would be quite this difficult. All my friends are already with child or have one of their own. Mother is frustrated that I am behind. I am sincerely trying, though. I really am.",
	Memento2 = "'We don't need money!' That's what he said to me this morning. No matter what I say, he still doesn't understand. Then I went to work for the first time in my life. It wasn't sewing or cooking or doing the laundry; it was something I wanted. Some things take longer than others to find their way in life, but they do. This flower hasn't yet, but I did. I finally did.",
	Memento3 = "The Memento Florum has grown, less than I expected when I planted it and more than I expected now that I'm old. Watching it, I had a revelation: things grow not from our expectations, but from what's within. Providing a safe haven is all that we can do. I suppose that's the meaning of being a mother.",
	Memento4 = "Mom has weird tastes. This Memoria Flora or whatever takes up a whole lot of space and doesn't even look good. I don't know why she'd put something so ugly right in the middle of the garden. She keeps trying to show me how to take care of it, but I'd rather go hang with my friends. I wish she'd stop.",
	Memento5 = "This stupid flower. Dying. AGAIN. It should either grow or just die! Why is stuck in this state, not quite alive, but not quite dead? Is it mocking me? It must be. How could he...? How could he choose her and not me? Why am I even here still?",
	Memento6 = "I think I'm killing it. The flower, the garden, my marriage... And I don't even know if I care.",
	Memento7 = "After all the work I put into it, it finally looks healthy again! If flowers could talk... How long has it taken us to get here? I think the journey was worth it.",
	Memento8 = "Of all the things in the garden, this flower is the one that stands out the most. It was grandma's favourite flower. Even I can remember that much. So...I don't understand why she's letting it die. I want to cherish it the way grandma did. I'll restore it, grandma. I promise!",
	Memento9 = "I've been studying gardening recently in my spare time, 'cause if mom's not gonna, I'm gonna fix it up! Problem is, I don't know if this flower is ever gonna bloom since mom neglected it so much. That doesn't mean I'm giving up! I'll get this flower blooming one way or another!",
	Memento10 = "Over the years, I've realized something: all things eventually come to an end. First my child, then my marriage, and now all I'm left with are scars. Some things...just aren't meant to be. I wonder if this flower is just one of those things...",
	Memento11 = "I'm not sure I have the words. This flower is beyond what I'd imagined. It's beautiful, gorgeous, magnificent. All those things! I sit here admiring it with Lily and can't help but think how much mom and grandma would have wanted to see this. How much as happened in this garden since grandma planted the first seed? Itâ€™s taken years and years to get here, but in this moment, I think it was all worth it. It's not just this flower. All the times we spent together and the memories we've created... I think that's the true beauty of this garden.",
	Berries0 = "A single berry is clinging to life on this bush. Looking at it, one would think it is quite sad. However, I do not see it in that way. All the other berries have ripened and all that remains is this one, also trying its best to reach its potential. That persistance is an admirable quality. I shall endeavour to have such a quality in my own life.",
	Berries1 = "My little one likes to get her hands into everything. Jam? Dirt? Mari cares not. Fortunately, this berry bush has more to spare. I had to throw out a whole jar when she got her hands in it after an escapade in the garden. She knows she can get away with these things. I love her so much I could barely scold her!",
	Berries2 = "Mari is a very restless child. Needless to say, the garden is not a setting she always enjoys. Mostly, she likes to eat the raw berries and play with the dirt, but she also stomps her feet and gets impatient while I care for the flowers. I know she'll like the garden. She just doesn't know it yet. Soon I'll have her help me with it and she'll make that discovery.",
	Berries3 = "Mother taught me to be a lady and I defined myself by that title. I cherish being a wife and a mother, but I am much more than just those things. I can have my own wants and desires independent of the concerns of my husband and daughter. There is, in fact, nothing wrong with that. A woman deserves to love herself as well.",
	Berries4 = "There's nothing better than having jam straight from the jar and licking your fingers clean afterwards. If there's one good thing about all the time mom spends in the garden, it's how yummy the berries are. Sometimes I'll pick them straight off the bush if I get impatient, but nothing beats mom's jam!",
	Berries5 = "The berries are ripe, but they don't shine the way they did when mother was caring for them. This is the first year I've tried making jam without her and...it doesn't taste right. I followed the recipe exactly, so I don't know what went wrong! At least, I'm pretty sure I did.",
	Berries6 = "Laid off. If that's any better than being fired, it sure doesn't feel like it. It's not that I enjoyed working under that asshole, but it paid the bills. Now I have a child to care for and a husband to support. This garden needs time and care that I just don't have for it. Selling it might solve a lot more problems than all the ones keeping it creates.",
	Berries7 = "I've finally cracked mom's jam recipe! It's not exactly the same--I've added a little spice to it, but it tastes just as good. It's only taken me decades! Still, now I can teach Chrysa how to make it too. It'll be our new family tradition.",
	Berries8 = "Mama put jam on my nose this morning. It tasted REALLY BAD, but at least we had fun in the kitchen making it (although we had to throw it out afterwards). I miss grandma's jam. It was just the right sweetness and only a tiny bit tart. I really hope mom figures out how to make it properly.",
	Berries9 = "We are so close! So close to cracking that jam recipe! Mom's been cooking up a storm in the kitchen whenever the bush grows enough berries and while we haven't quite gotten grandma's jam down, it's been a really good time. We clash about a lot of things in general, but when it comes to jam? We just have a good time.",
	Berries10 = "Jam-making has always been a mom and daughter thing. Even back when I called my mom 'mama,' I was in the kitchen with her making inedible jam. And now...what's the point? I'll leave the berries. I can't make jam when there's no one to share it with.",
	Berries11 = "I had to be selective in order to get enough berries to make jam, but I did it! It was a little awkward in the kitchen when Lily asked about having a father, but I told her the truth. I'm not sure she'll ever have one. Have to say, I was pretty surprised when Lily told me she was fine with that. Then she called me her 'moppa,' because I'm like two parents in one. I've never heard of that term before, but I really liked it. More than 'mom'! I think I'll ask her to keep calling me that.",
	Daisies0 = "I am certainly glad to have grown these daisies. Mother is teaching me how to be a lady. She worked during the war, but says I will not have to do so. Instead, I must be a proper lady. Unfortunately, I am not so good at sewing and mother yelled at me today for having such loose stitches. I so detest disappointing her, but the vibrance of the daisies always lift my spirits.",
	Daisies1 = "Finally, I am somebody's wife. It was a small ceremony, but beautiful nonetheless. I wore a piece of this garden as well. This place... It has become a part of me. I remember my father's love when I am here. He could not walk me down the aisle, but I could feel him with me all the same.",
	Daisies2 = "The daisies needed so much work today and I was already quite exhausted from arguing with my husband. I think I want to get a job. In fact, I'm quite certain that's what I want. My father was a hero in our society. Can I not be the same? I wish Mari would help me with the garden. Maybe I could relax for just a moment...",
	Daisies3 = "Daisies always need so much work to keep them under control. The joints in my hands ache, but I've always understood gardening is a labour of love. Mari has been helping me, though it's clear she doesn't want to. Regardless, I'm grateful she's joined me, even just to have her presence. It may not be the most fun, but the work has to be done.",
	Daisies4 = "Is this garden a boon or a curse? It's so filled with thriving life that I often feel unneeded, while at the same time, it cries out for attention. It's comforting to have something in life so devoid of expectations: what I wear, who I walk with, or how I behave. All of it is the same to the green surrounding me. I wonder if it's why mom spends so much time here, why she cares more for the garden than me.",
	Daisies5 = "A flower as a weapon? Yeah right. I'm sure that'll protect me from all the stabby weapons. Hm, but maybe beauty is quite a thing to wield. A man falls to his knees in the presence of it, doesn't he? If only we were still talking about flowers. What a joke.",
	Daisies6 = "Rock bottom. I thought I'd gotten there, but then I kept falling and falling until I lost sight of where I was. Then, from out of nowhere, a helping hand from my own daughter, a daisy clutched in her little fingers just for me. Some things are always there to make the unbearable a little more manageable. A light showing me the way. ",
	Daisies7 = "I'm not sure I've ever been so happy before. The day we met in that flower shop was a blessing in disguise. She and Chrysa get along like two peas in a pod too! I'm so grateful to have her with me. Just knowing there's someone I can truly rely on, someone who will hold my hand... It's all I could ever ask for.",
	Daisies8 = "Mama has been so sad lately. She even hates coming to the garden. Maybe it's all the fights she and dad have been getting into. The daisies are usually nice all year round, so how come they aren't right now? Please, please bloom soon. Maybe if mama sees how beautiful they are, she'll cheer up a bit.",
	Daisies9 = "When I cut my hair, mom made a big stink about it. Now that it's growing back, she's all WOOHOO! Sigh... Maybe I'll keep it long so people will stop talking about it. It really just feels more ME when it's short. I don't mind eyes on me, but I don't want them on me for this.",
	Daisies10 = "Am I beautiful? I don't know. Everyone calls me a beautiful woman, but when I look in the mirror, that's not what I see. That's not a woman looking back at me. How can they all see the same thing when I see myself so differently?",
	Daisies11 = "My first month of retirement has been very introspective. Since Lily's at school, I've had a lot of time to myself to think. Like the daisies, I've always felt most beautiful in the garden at any time of the year. The only person who can judge me here is me, and if I let myself be the way that I am, something inside me just...shines.",
	Fern4 = "Of all the gifts I've received in college, a fern is the one I least suspected. Some guy gave it to me, babbling on about how it has a unique beauty that flowers don't. At first, I really didn't care about what he was saying, but now that I look at it...he may have a point.",
	Fern5 = "Can you have regrets about something you couldn't control? I don't know, but it doesn't change the way I feel. This fern makes my heart ache. Ironic that I keep his gift when he probably never thinks of me. I found someone else instead. He's safe and smart and stable but... That's all he is.",
	Fern6 = "I waited for so long to leave him because I thought it would better for Chrysa, but we're all happier now that it's been done. Now I work not only for my family, but for myself too. I can let myself be as wild as the fronds of this fern again. Yesterday, I went skinny-dipping just 'cause I wanted to, and nobody had a damn thing to say about it!",
	Fern7 = "Some things in life need a little guidance. This fern always has. That's why I always trim it. But this fern relies on me for every bit of care it receives. I can't do that for my daughter and it scares me. Will she be okay after I'm gone? Is the guidance I've given her enough?",
	Fern8 = "We put on a play at summer camp today. I got to be the princess and wore a really nice dress, but my friend got to be the prince. He got to wear this dashing outfit while I just felt weird and unnatural. I told the counsellor I wanted to be the prince, but she just told me I should be happy to be the princess 'cause it's the role every girl wants. Not me. Why can't I be the prince?",
	Fern9 = "Ugh, this fern! All these nasty giant fronds hanging from everywhere! I want to cut them so bad. It'll look so much better, but I know it's healthier for the plant if I leave them. I have to remember that outside appearance doesn't always match what's on the inside. Plants are such a curious thing. A lot of things about them apply so much to us as people, and we don't even realize it.",
	Fern10 = "Cut the fronds and cut my hair! You know what? Keeping it long never made me happy. It just made me look more feminine, which made everyone else happy. Right now, I don't care. It's my decision to look as feminine as I want.",
	Fern11 = "It feels so freeing to accept myself as I am. I'm so happy and comfortable with myself. But I also feel like I can be a better parent to Lily knowing who I am. She'll never have to grow up with the pressure to be anything other than who she wants to be. I'll make sure her roots are planted in a different way my own were.",
	Roses6 = "I had a lovely chat in the flower shop today. She was looking for the right pot for her new plants and the employees were too busy to help her, so I did. We bonded over the recent changes in our life and her relentless optimism just lifted me. She had the most marvelous laugh. Warm, like sunshine in the beginning of spring. Our hands brushed when we reached for the same pot. God... I hope she didnâ€™t notice me blushing... I hope I see her again.",
	Roses7 = "The garden keeps surprising me! Whenever I think Iâ€™ve got everything figured out, something changes. A flower that refused to blossom one day opens up and reveals the sweetest aroma. I used to feel out of place in it, but now, when Iâ€™m away, I canâ€™t help but wonder what will happen next.",
	Roses8 = "The petals are falling off the roses today. I love their smell. It reminds me of love. A lot of the girls I know look and me and think that's something that would never cross my mind, but I dream about it just like anyone else. I want to find the love of my life, someone who just understands me perfectly.",
	Roses9 = "This is it. I'm in love. He's my most supportive friend and he accepts me for everything that I am. He doesn't criticize how I dress or how loud I am or how crazy about gardening I get! He loves me for me, just like I dreamed. Ahhhh! My heart is as out of control as the roses are! ",
	Roses10 = "I met a really kind man at work today. He asked me on a date and I accepted, but I don't feel right about it. With everything that happened in my marriage, I just... I don't want to feel hurt like that again.",
	Roses11 = "It's like my mind was filled with locked doors my entire life and now I suddenly have a skeleton key. There's nothing beyond my reach. I can be my own person because I finally understand who I am. All the times that I was judged, by others and then myselfâ€¦ Iâ€™m so sorry. All this hurt, all this pain, all of it from desperation simply because I was different and wanted to fit in. I see myself as I am, laid bare of expectations. Just...being.",
	Carnation8 = "I don't really know what the best season to plant carnations is, but they're going to be a surprise for mama. I've read that carnations are traditional Mother's Day flowers. Once they grow, it'll be Mother's Day every day of the year!",
	Carnation9 = "Mother. That's who I planted these for. And now... Will that be me? The life growing inside me is both a terrifying and delightful thought. My husband is out of his mind with excitement. But me? A mother? It doesn't feel right to call myself that, and the changes to my body--my breasts! I don't even want to think about it. I wish these feelings would go away. For the baby's sake.",
	Carnation10 = "I remember my mom's reaction when the carnations first grew. She was so happy her child had done something like that for her. I've...always felt confused. About the world. About myself. About myself in this world. But the one thing I know more than anything is that I want to be a parent. I want to be someone who nurtures life in this world.",
	Carnation11 = "Adoption is the word of the day! Lily's become the joy of my life. When I fell in love with my ex-husband, I really thought he was the love of my life. Now I see her. The shine of her eyes, the lilt of her voice, the way that she smiles and I know... I was wrong.",
	Pansies8 = "The pansies are a little wilted today. I think they're thirsty. I know how they feel, though. It's really hot in here, but I'm hiding from mama. She says I'm not dressing 'girly' enough and keeps bugging me about it. Is it really that bad? I don't do it every day, and when I do, I like it better. Maybe there's something wrong with me.",
	Pansies9 = "The garden is so big now and full of so many flowers. Is this was grandma intended when she made it? When I sit here and take in my surroundings, I know I'm in a place of rich history and beauty. Here, everything makes sense. Everything can be as it is and I am the one who helps things grow. It's only outside these walls where everything is confusing again...",
	Pansies10 = "They're blooming in the winter! How resilient! That's such an admirable quality. I used to think I was like that, but...life wears you down, I guess. The pansies, though? They're beautiful, even in the harshness of the winter. I wish I could be like that again.",
	Pansies11 = "I bought a new spray bottle earlier to use in the garden, but the label on it was so sticky! No matter how much I tried to scrape it off, it was always still a little bit there. Note to self: buy some rubbing alcohol so you can finally get it all off.",
	Sunflower0 = "I was given a gift today, my first from a young man! He was blushing as he gave it to me and I thought my heart would beat out of my chest. He had given me sunflower seeds to use in my garden. It is such a thoughtful gift. I am so very excited to plant them! Oh, if only these butterflies in my stomach would go away...",
	Sunflower1 = "My husband planted the seed of our future when he gave me those sunflower seeds. Now I am with child. His. And we are going to be a family. Nothing in this world brings me more joy. Though he wishes for a boy to carry on the family name, I hope for a girl. I imagine spending the days in this garden with my little girl, who will love this place and its beauty just as much as I do.",
	Sunflower2 = "The sunflower is perfect today. It's so beautiful that even Mari in enamoured with it! She has never asked me to take so many pictures of her! I love seeing her smile like that. I wish she always was. If I could freeze a moment in time, it would be this one.",
	Sunflower3 = "There are quite a few sunflower seeds to pick up today. It's remarkable. Each time the flower dies, it leaves new life behind to grow. I like to think my life has been spent sowing my own, that I've left an impact on each and every person I care for and love. Mari, my little seedling, still doesn't like this garden and she scarcely visits me these days. Still, I am proud of her. She is her own woman and that's all I ever wanted.",
	Sunflower4 = "Yellow is the colour of joy. That's something I firmly believe. There are no feelings of sorrow or harrow in the presence of yellow. As a child, I danced around the sunflower and had that very thought, how the petals are so bright and beautiful it blasts away the darkness in your heart. Yellow is the colour of joy.",
	Sunflower5 = "I tried to sing. They covered their ears. I tried to write. They laughed. I try to draw my favourite thing, and even I know it's terrible. Will there ever be something I'm good at? Please? Whatever it is, I'd love to find out.",
	Sunflower6 = "When they die, all in the world is as it alway was: uncaring, unchanging. But we, somehow, are irredeemably different. We have a choice. I...donâ€™t want to be that person anymore. I'm done waiting for life to deal me a better hand. I'll make myself a better hand.",
	Sunflower7 = "Chrysa has been acting strange recently. She cut her hair and it broke my heart. She's always had such beautiful hair. I don't understand why she felt the need to make it so, so short, and yet she was upset with me when I asked her about it. I shut my mouth after that. She's seemed so lost lately and I don't know what to do to help her. This sunflower has always helped me find my most beautiful self, and I hope she can find hers too.",
	Sunflower8 = "It's hard to miss how pretty the sunflower is, but that's not all it is, is it? I've always been a bit loud and energetic. That's what my friends tell me, but I didn't see a problem with that. Today, my teacher told me to be a good girl and be quiet. Is that what I'm supposed to do? Am I just supposed to be a quiet, pretty thing to look at?",
	Sunflower9 = "It's almost dead now, but this last bloom was the biggest and most gorgeous sunflower I've ever seen. Mom has really started to take an interest in the garden. I think that's why. It's like she's starting a new life with this partner of hers. Her name is Primrose. I really like her, and I really like what she's done for my mom.",
	Sunflower10 = "Even in death, we keep this tiny, endless piece within us. Some might see a dried out sunflower, but its image echoes in me like waves of gold. I think it's like love. It never really leaves you. Maybe that's why all these relationships have been so short-lived. He was the perfect boyfriend, but I just didn't feel like I could love him. I don't know if I'm still hung up on my ex-husband or if it's just me. I think there's something wrong with me.",
	Sunflower11 = "I've gotten a bit serious with teaching Lily how to care for the garden recently. It's been great! She's so eager to learn and I'm happy to share it with her. I told her all about how her grandma's favourite flower in the garden was the sunflower, and how she firmly believed the colours banished sadness from the heart. Just from that story, I think the sunflower's become Lily's favourite as well.",
